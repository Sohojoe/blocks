## Blocks World Simulator, Code, and Models (Misra et al. EMNLP 2017)

**Note:** We are releasing a new software called the Cornell Instruction Following Framework (CIFF). CIFF provides a common interface for blocks corpus and three other corpuses. CIFF also contains implementation of various model and learning algorithm including asynchronous learning for faster training. All new developments on block world simulator and code will now be done with the CIFF framework. We won't be actively developing this repository.

**Please follow the CIFF repository for new developments:** https://github.com/clic-lab/ciff

**The original environment was designed by [Bisk et al. 2016](http://yonatanbisk.com/papers/2016-NAACL.pdf), who also collected the [data](https://groundedlanguage.github.io/).**

### Run the Code in 60 Seconds (Requires only python 2.7)

In this section, we will run the oracle baseline on the devset. 
This will give an idea of the simulator and the code and does not requires any dependency besides python 2.7.

**Supports:** Linux (with Unity Desktop) + MacOS

**Requires:** python2.7

#### Run a simple baseline on MacOS
1) Clone the code  ``git clone https://github.com/clic-lab/blocks``
2) Now run the file ``mac_build.app`` by double clicking.

   Choose the Fastest mode setting and any resolution (does not matter which resolution). 
   
   **Note**: The screen will remain black and the window will be frozen until you run the python agent.
3) Finally run the oracle baseline by running the following command in the home directory.
   May take 5-10 seconds for the simulator to be ready and before following command works.
     
      ``cd ./blocks/BlockWorldRoboticAgent/``
      
      ``export PYTHONPATH=<location-of-blocks-folder>/BLockWorldRoboticAgent/:$PYTHONPATH``
      
      ``python ./experiments/test_oracle.py``
      
   You can similarly run ``python ./experiments/test_stop.py`` and ``python ./experiments/test_random.py``
   to run stop and random walk baselines respectively.
      
4) The log will be generated in ``./blocks/BlockWorldRoboticAgent/log.txt`` and final number should match
    the numbers in the paper *0.35 mean distance error*.


#### Run a simple baseline on Linux

1) Clone the code  ``git clone https://github.com/clic-lab/blocks``
2) Go to ``./blocks/BlockWorldSimulator/`` and make the file ``linux_build.x86_64`` executable by running:

     ``chmod 777 linux_build.x86_64``

3) Now run the file ``linux_build.x86_64`` by double clicking.

   Choose the Fastest mode setting and any resolution (does not matter which resolution). 
   
   **Note**: The screen will remain black and the window will be frozen until you run the python agent.
   
4) Finally run the oracle baseline by running the following command in the home directory.
   May take 5-10 seconds for the simulator to be ready and before following command works.
     
      ``cd ./blocks/BlockWorldRoboticAgent/``
      
      ``export PYTHONPATH=<location-of-blocks-folder>/BLockWorldRoboticAgent/:$PYTHONPATH``
      
      ``python ./experiments/test_oracle.py``
      
   You can similarly run ``python ./experiments/test_stop.py`` and ``python ./experiments/test_random.py``
   to run stop and random walk baselines respectively.
      
5) The log will be generated in ``./blocks/BlockWorldRoboticAgent/log.txt`` and final number should match
    the numbers in the paper *0.35 mean distance error*.
    
Instructions for running other baselines will come soon.
